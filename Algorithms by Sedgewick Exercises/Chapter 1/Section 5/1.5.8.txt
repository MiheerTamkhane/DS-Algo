When i = p, id[i] will be pointing to id[p] and it will be replaced by id[q].
So now we'll be comparing a different value in the if condition

This can be fixed by adding another codition in the coditional statement which will check if i!=p
if(i != p && id[i] == id[p]){
  id[i] = id[q];
}
id[p] = id[q]; 

or we can store the value of id[p] in variable and use that in the coditional statement
let temp = id[p];
if(id[i] == temp){
  id[i] = id[q];
}
