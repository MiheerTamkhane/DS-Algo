total for-loop iterations = no of input pairs x no of sites 
= 10^6 x 10^9 
= 10^15

Total no of machine instructions = total for-loop iterations x instructions required per iteration 
= 10^15 x 10 
= 10^16

Machine executes 10^9 instructions per second
total no of seconds = total no of machine instructions / iterations done per second
= 10^16 / 10^9 
= 10^7

10^7 seconds = 166,666 minutes = 2,777 hours = ~115 days
