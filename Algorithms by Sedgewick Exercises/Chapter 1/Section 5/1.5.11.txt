The Quick Find algorithm requires us to loop through the whole array to find the id's of the components that we need to modify.
Even if we take the decision according to the size we would still have to loop through the entire array, the number of assignment opertaions would be 
reduced but there is no asymptotic improvement i.e it is still linear time.
