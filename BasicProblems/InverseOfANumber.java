// Question
// if the number is 5 digits long, it'll contain all the digits from 1 to 5 without missing and repeating any digit from 1 to 5
// If we have a number 426135 here we can see that 5 is in the 1st position and 3 is in the 2nd position
// To calculate inverse of a number we'll put 1 in the 5th place and 2 in the 3rd place doing so for all the digits
// so the inverse would be 416253
